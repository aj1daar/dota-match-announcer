# GEMINI rules

Do not use comment lines in code.
Whenever a file is edited, created, or refactored, ensure all linting (including Prettier) rules are followed.
Whenever file is edited/created/changed → check it for TS errors and fix them.
When required make commits: <feat/chore/fix/refactor> - <short description of the change in the past tense, no more than 50 characters>.
